	This is a Java Project on Hotel Management System. I have tried my best to make the complicated process of Hotel Management System as simple as possible using Structured & Modular technique & Menu oriented interface. 

	The software is designed in such a way that employees may not have any difficulty in using this package & further expansion is possible without much effort. Even though I cannot claim that this work to be entirely exhaustive, the main purpose of my exercise is perform each Employee’s activity in computerized way rather than manually which is time consuming.

	I am confident that this software package can be readily used by non-programming personal avoiding human handled chance of error.

	This project is used by two types of users –
 1. Employees
 2. Admin (Manager)
